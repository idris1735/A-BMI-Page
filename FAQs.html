          Obesity among 2- to 19-year-olds is defined as a BMI at or above the
          95th percentile of children of the same age and sex in this 1963 to
          1994 reference population. For example, a 10-year-old boy of average
          height (56 inches) who weighs 102 pounds would have a BMI of 22.9
          kg/m2. This would place the boy in the 95th percentile for BMI –
          meaning that his BMI is greater than that of 95% of similarly aged
          boys in this reference population – and he would be considered to have
          obesity.

          The accuracy of BMI as an indicator of body fatness also appears to be
          higher in persons with higher levels of BMI and body fatness16. While,
          a person with a very high BMI (e.g., 35 kg/m2) is very likely to have
          high body fat, a relatively high BMI can be the results of either high
          body fat or high lean body mass (muscle and bone). A trained
          healthcare provider should perform appropriate health assessments to
          evaluate an individual’s health status and risks.

          According to the BMI weight status categories, anyone with a BMI

          However, athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity
          rather than increased body fatness. In general, a person who has a
          high BMI is likely to have body fatness and would be considered to be
          overweight or obese, but this may not apply to athletes. A trained
          healthcare provider should perform appropriate health assessments to
          evaluate an individual’s health status and risks.
